# It is strongly recommended to configure settings using the program, not this file.



# SETTINGS FILE
# This file contains configuration settings for the application. Follow these rules when editing:
# 1. Use True/False for boolean values.
# 2. Follow the specified format for values to avoid errors.
# 3. Descriptions and examples are provided to help you understand each setting.

# [OPERATION]
# - mode: Sets the operational mode of the program. broker/client/both/admin
#     + broker: Allows clients to communicate through this device. Displays as console and enables automatic network moderation features.
#     + client: Allows users to view, create, delete, edit, and receive objects. Enables touch-based GUI, can be used with mouse/keyboard.
#     + both: Enables all features of both broker and client. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WEAKER DEVICES.
#     + admin: This device will have access to all objects, clients on network. This device will be able to push simple commands to clients on network. 
#         + Broker MUST be configured to allow this device to operate as admin.

# [GUI SETTINGS]
# - fullscreen: Set to False for non-thin-client environments. Recommended: False
# - vkeyboard: Enables on-screen keyboard. Recommended: True for touch-based clients. True/False
# - theme: Choose a theme for the GUI. Available options:
#     + LIGHT THEMES: light, light_blue, light_green
#     + DARK THEMES: dark, dark_blue, dark_red, dark_purple
#     + UNLISTED THEMES: super_dark, h4x0r, pride (Note: 'pride' requires extra system resources and may impact performance)
# - main_object_name: Name used for primary objects in your workflow (e.g., "Order", "Customer", "Request").
# - main_object_subtitle: Subtitle for primary objects (e.g., "Phone Number", "Amount").
# - main_obj_flag_a_name: Custom name for "flag_a" of primary objects.
# - main_obj_flag_b_name: Custom name for "flag_b" of primary objects.
# - main_flags_enable: Enables display of primary object flags. True/False
# - main_enable_masking: Masks primary object subtitles to protect sensitive data. True/False
# - main_enable_timer: Displays a timer for primary objects (time since creation). True/False
# - secondary_object_name: Name used for secondary objects in your workflow (e.g., "Item", "Task", "Note").
# - secondary_flag_a_name: Custom name for "flag_a" of secondary objects.
# - secondary_flag_b_name: Custom name for "flag_b" of secondary objects.
# - secondary_enable_masking: Masks secondary object subtitles to protect sensitive data. True/False
# - secondary_enable_timer: Displays a timer for secondary objects (time since creation). True/False
# - timer_update_delay: Interval (in seconds) between object timer updates. Longer intervals reduce system load.
# - debug: Enables debugging features. Recommended: False for standard users. True/False

# [NETWORK SETTINGS]
# - broker_ip: IP address of the broker.
# - broker_qos: Quality of Service for message delivery:
#     + 0: Best effort (no guarantee, may lose messages)
#     + 1: Guaranteed delivery (may result in duplicates)
#     + 2: Exactly-once delivery (most reliable, but slowest)
# - broker_port: Port used for broker communication. Default: 1883

# [CLIENT SETTINGS]
# - client_id: Unique identifier for each client.
# - client_audience: Group identifier for broadcasting messages to multiple clients.

# [SECRETS] - KEEP THIS SECTION CONFIDENTIAL
# Secrets will be removed from this file in a future revision for enhanced security.
# - client_psk: Primary pre-shared key (PSK). Must be a 64-character hexadecimal string.
#      + Automatically refreshes every 3 months.
# - client_backup_psk: Backup pre-shared key. Must be a 64-character hexadecimal string.
#      + Can be refreshed manually using the `gen_bu_psk.py` script.
# - client_psk_exp_date: Expiration date of the primary PSK. Automatically updated upon refresh.

# [BROKER SETTINGS]
# - enable_broker: Enables the client to function as a broker. Not recommended for devices with limited resources. True/False
# - broker_only_mode: Disables all client functionality and provides a console for managing broker services. True/False
